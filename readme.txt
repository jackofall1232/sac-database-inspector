Inspect database usage, autoloaded options, transients, and safely clean database clutter from a single admin dashboard.

== Description ==

**SAC Database Inspector** is a lightweight, admin-only utility designed to help site administrators understand what is stored in their site’s database and cache — and clean it up safely when needed.

Unlike aggressive “optimizer” plugins, Database Inspector focuses on **visibility first**, showing you where bloat exists before offering optional, manual cleanup actions.

### Key features:
* Database health gauge with clear visual feedback
* View total database size (when supported by hosting)
* Inspect autoloaded options that load on every page
* Identify expired and unused transients
* Detect post revisions, auto-drafts, spam, and trash
* Find orphaned post meta and comment meta
* Flush external object cache (when enabled)
* Optional read-only mode via filter for audit-only environments
* Multisite-aware and shared-host safe
* No frontend impact — admin-only
* Contextual source identification for autoloaded options

All cleanup actions require explicit confirmation and are protected by nonces and capability checks.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install via the Plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu.
3. Navigate to **Tools → DB Inspector** to view database statistics.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin safe to use? =
Yes. All cleanup actions are manual, protected, and clearly labeled. No background jobs or automatic deletions are performed.

= Does this work on shared hosting? =
Yes. If database size information is restricted by your host, the plugin degrades gracefully without errors.

= Does this support multisite? =
Yes. Multisite installations are supported, including site transients and object cache detection.

= Does this affect frontend performance? =
No. The plugin loads only in the admin area.

= Can I disable cleanup actions? =
Yes. Developers can enable read-only mode using the `wpdi_read_only` filter.

= How does the plugin identify option sources? =
The plugin uses pattern matching based on option name prefixes and common WordPress naming conventions. This is an educated guess, not definitive information. Source identification helps you understand which plugin or system component likely created an option.
